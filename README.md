# [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

The game of life is a simple 2D cellular automaton. Cells are governed by three simple rules:

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours persists
* Any live cell without two or three live neighbours dies
* Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell

This web application that uses the HTML5 Boilerplate lets the user play the game of life on their browser.
